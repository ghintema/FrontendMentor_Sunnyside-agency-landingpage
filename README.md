- defining CSS variables
- defining CSS utility classes
- writing markup, including styles via utility classes
- writing layout for mobile design
- writing layout for desktop


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Custom CSS Utility classes for fonts and style for max mantainability 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- No frameworks used.


### What I learned

- working with pseudo-elements to make underlining 
- kombining :after with :hover
- liquid responsiveness 
- changing the order of elements in a flex-box

#card-4 .learn-more:after        {background-color:#ffdbd4;}
#card-2 .learn-more:hover::after,
#card-2 .learn-more:active::after  {background-color:#fad400}
#card-4 .learn-more:hover:after,
#card-4 .learn-more:active::after  {background-color:#fe7766}
